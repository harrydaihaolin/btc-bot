Set these environment variables:

```

## üéØ Usage

export BTC_USERNAME="your_email@example.com"
export BTC_PASSWORD="your_password"
export BTC_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
export BTC_PHONE_NUMBER="1234567890"

## üì± Notification Features

### Email Notifications
- Sent via Gmail SMTP
- Includes court details and booking URL
- Professional formatting with emojis

### SMS Notifications
- Supports Canadian carriers (Rogers, Bell, Telus, etc.)
- Uses email-to-SMS gateways
- Fallback to console output if SMS fails

## üîç How It Works

1. **Login**: Automatically logs into BTC website
2. **Multi-Date Scan**: Checks today, tomorrow, and day after tomorrow
3. **Smart Detection**: Finds all "Book" buttons across all dates
4. **Filter**: Removes false positives like "Booking Grid - None"
5. **Organize**: Groups courts by date for clear notifications
6. **Notify**: Sends email and SMS when courts are found
7. **Monitor**: Optional continuous monitoring with configurable intervals

## üìä Monitoring Options

After the initial scan, you can choose:

1. **Continuous Monitoring** (every 5 minutes) - Perfect for background monitoring
2. **Timeslot Monitoring** (every 30 seconds) - For rapid availability changes
3. **Exit** - Single scan mode

### Interactive vs Non-Interactive Mode
- **Interactive Mode**: Full user prompts and monitoring options
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Perfect for cron jobs and automated deployments
- **Automatic Detection**: Bot automatically adapts to your environment

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Credentials are stored in environment variables
- Passwords are hidden during input
- Gmail App Passwords provide secure SMTP access
- No hardcoded credentials in the code

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Interactive input not available"**
   - Set environment variables instead
   - Use the setup script: `./setup_credentials.sh`

2. **"Login failed"**
   - Check your BTC credentials
   - Ensure the website is accessible

3. **"Email sending failed"**
   - Verify Gmail App Password
   - Check 2-Step Verification is enabled

4. **"No courts found"**
   - This is normal - courts are only available when someone cancels
   - The bot will notify you when courts become available

### Debug Files

The bot creates several debug files:
- `btc_booking_page_*.png` - Screenshots
- `btc_booking_page_*.html` - Page source
- `btc_mon27_page_source_*.html` - Tomorrow's page source
- `btc_notification_*.txt` - Notification logs
- `available_courts_*.json` - Court data
